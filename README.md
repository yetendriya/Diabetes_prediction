Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
# OVERVIEW:
This repository contains a Python script for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is built using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and MLxtend. The dataset used for this project consists of relevant features and outcomes related to diabetes. Various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are employed to develop and compare predictive models.

# KEY FEATURES:
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and standardization, to prepare it for training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Exploratory analysis is performed using Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between different features.

Model Selection:
Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers are implemented to predict diabetes based on the given features.

Performance Evaluation:
The models are evaluated using accuracy score to measure their effectiveness in predicting diabetes.

LIBRARIES USED:

NumPy: For numerical operations and calculations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Missingno: For visualizing missing data patterns.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory analysis.

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms implementation and evaluation.

MLxtend: For visualizing decision boundaries of the models.
